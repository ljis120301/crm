# Internal Customer lookup datbase

What I need 

- I need a full stack web application that will act as essentially a contact book. A receptionist must be able to use this site to log customer names and information, And store that information in a database. This needs to be able to be built to run in a docker contianer for final deployment that will include the databse in the docker container. 

What to look out for 
- I do not know what fields they need, some can be safley assumed like "Customer name, and phone number" but aside from the requried fields a receptionist should be able to add in as many other fields as they need, You or I will never be able to predict all fields they need to a user needs to be able to add or remove required fields as needed, as well as manage the overall required fields, So if the buisness finds that every customer is required to also have an ID number, I receptionist goes in and makes a new field called "ID" and checks a box that says "required" 


You will build this in next js, using only shadcn componenets, You will not install radix components, You will properly use Shadcn

You are never permitted to run a dev server, you will always assume I am running the project
